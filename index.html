            This is a paragraph about me and some of my interests. I <em>really</em> 
            like trying new things regardless of the amount of time consumed. 
            Some of the things I like include soldering, coding, and typing. 
            <strong>Typing</strong> has especially had a recent development among 
            my many hobbies. Building and trying different keyboards and switches 
            seems really fun.
